           <h2>OSF</h2>
            <p>
			  Asynchronous parts of SALT 30 will be hosted on OSF Meetings, 
			  a free poster and presentation sharing service for 
			  academic meetings and conferences. 
			</p>
			<p>		
              Each presentation at SALT 30 will have its own OSF page on the 
			  <a href="https://osf.io/meetings/SALT30/">SALT 30 repository</a>. 
			  You can upload your abstract, videos, slides, handouts, and paper 
			  draft to the presentation page. Enabling comments on your project 
			  page will facilitate asynchronous discussion of your research.
			</p>
			<p>	
   			  Please create your OSF page by 
			  <span class="alert">Wednesday, July 15 2020</span>, 
			  upload your abstract (with your names added), and send us the 
			  project page url. We will link to it in the program. If you do not
			  want to create an OSF page, please send us your abstract with names
			  added by the same date, July 15. Additional material can then be 
			  <a href="#edit">added</a> to your OSF page.
            </p>
			<p>	
			  If you are <a href="#record">recording</a> a poster lightning talk, 
			  we will need these videos by <span class="alert">Monday, August 13 
			  2020</span> so that we can prepare them for the lightning talk 
			  sessions. Other <a href="#record">prerecorded videos</a> are also 
			  due at this time. You can email them to us or upload them to OSF and 
			  send us the link.
            </p>

            <h2 id="options">Presentation Options</h2>
            <p>
              To accomodate presenters and participants across the globe, we have several 
              different presentation options. If you have not let us know your preference, 
              please do so as soon as you can. 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Paper sessions: 30 minute talk, 10 minute questions
              </li>
              <li>
                Poster sessions: 3 minute lightning talk, 1 hour discussion
              </li>
              <li>
                Invited talk sessions: 45 minute talk, 15 minute questions
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Live talk, live questions</h3>
            <p>
              For paper presenters: you can give your talk and questions live in a 
              scheduled time slot. If you would like to record your talk and make it
              available afterwards, you can record it on your local computer and post
              it to your OSF page afterwards. If you do so, please announce this at
              the beginning of your talk.
            </p>
            <p>
              We encourage you to also post materials to your OSF project page (e.g., 
              handout, slides, paper draft) so that conference attendees in different 
              time zones can engage with your material.
            </p>
            <h3>Prerecorded talk, live questions</h3>
            <p>
              You can prerecord your talk, have it played in a particular time slot, 
              and answer questions live afterwards. This will include all lightning 
              talks: all lightning talks for a poster session will be played, to be
              followed by individual discussion rooms for each poster. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We encourage you to also post materials to your OSF project page (e.g., 
              video, handout, slides, paper draft) so that conference attendees in 
              different time zones can engage with your material.
            </p>
            <h3>Asynchronous Only</h3>
            <p>
              The asynchronous only option means that you will be interacting with 
              your presentation audience through your SALT OSF page only. We encourage 
              you to upload your materials (e.g., video, handout, slides, paper draft) 
              by August 13th and also turn on comments on your project page at least 
              from August 13 &ndash; August 20, 2020, through the end of the conference.
			</p>
			<p>
			  To count as having presented at SALT30 for the sake of the proceedings, 
			  presenters must at least upload a poster, handout, or slides to OSF.

            <h2 id="edit">Editing Your OSF Project page</h2>
			<p>
		      If you are logged in to OSF, you can edit your project page. The project page has several tabs at the top   where you can go to edit your page. You can also add tags or keywords to describe your presentation by typing them into the `Tags' box. <br>
			  <img class="resize" src="pics/pic6.png" alt="SALT OSF project page"><br><br>

			<p>
		      Uploading more files is easy. Simply drag the file from where it is stored on your computer and drop it in the area of the `Files' box. You can also go to the `Files' tab at the top of the page and do the same. <br>
			  <img class="resize" src="pics/pic7.png" alt="SALT OSF drag and drop files"><br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
	       If you go to the `Files' tab, you can edit files that you have already added. When you click on a file, you have the option to download, view, delete, check out (make it so other contributors cannot change it), or rename the file. <br>
			<img class="resize" src="pics/pic8.png" alt="Editing files"><br><br>

You also have the option of comparing the current version to a previous version. Make sure to click `Save' at the bottom of the editing box to apply your changes.

			</p>
			<p>

			    If they have an OSF account, you can search for them to add them. If they do not have an OSF account you can add them as an unregistered contributor using their email. You can give them access to view and/or edit the project page. You may also want to make sure they are listed as a `Bibliographic Contributor'. 
			</p>
			<p>

            <h2 id="proceedings">Proceedings</h2>
            <p>
              All presenters at SALT30 may publish in the proceedings. An email will be 
              sent to authors by the editors, but some information is below. 
            </p>  
            <p>
              The page limit is 18 pages for talks and posters (24 pages for invited
              talks). This does not include references, but does include all other 
              material. 
            </p>  
            <p>
              Papers will be accepted from the final day of the conference, August 20, 
              until September 30, 2020.  We know this is a compressed timeline for 
              writing up the papers, but we want the proceedings to have the same year 
              as the conference, despite the delated conference date due to the pandemic.  
            </p>  
            <p>
              Drafts of the proceedings paper can be posted on OSF before your presentation, 
              if you want. Some audience members may look at the full paper beforehand 
              and it could provide the opportunity to engage in a detailed way.

              We invite submission of abstracts for 30-minute oral presentations
              (with an additional 10 minutes for questions) or posters on any
              topic in natural language semantics with relevance to linguistic
              theory.

            <hr>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              Abstracts must be anonymous. The main text should be at most 2
              pages (US Letter or A4) in length, including examples, with an 
              optional third page for references. The abstract should use a 12pt
              font and 1 inch margins (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4)
              on all four sides. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF
              file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to
              the intellectual interest of the abstract, clarity and readability
              will also be taken into account in reviewing. </p>
            <p>
              SALT 30 will feature a poster session. Poster presentations will					<!--modify-->
              be published as regular papers in the proceedings. Poster
              presenters will be asked to give a short lightning round
              presentation prior to the poster session. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Policies</h2>
            <p>
              Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the
              sole author of at most one abstract.
            </p>
            <p>
              SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been
              published or have been accepted for publication. In addition,
              preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated
              at other major conferences. 
            </p> 
            <p>
              If the work or a close variant of it is under submission to or accepted 
              for publication or presentation in any other major venue (such as a national 
              or international conference or a journal/book chapter), we request that the 
              authors create a small section titled “Additional Submission” after the 
              references at the end of the paper. This section should include the other 
              venue(s) for which the work has been submitted, the status of those submissions, 
              and an indication of any major aspects of the SALT abstract not submitted 
              elsewhere. We require that authors update us by email if/when there is a 
              relevant change in the status of other submissions.
            </p>
            <p>
			  SALT has a <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a> and by submitting an abstract and by attending the 
			  conference, you are agreeing to abide by the code.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Proceedings</h2>
            <p>
              All papers presented at the conference will be published in a SALT 30 volume 				<!--modify-->

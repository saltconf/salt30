            </p>
            <p>
              Submissions should be made via the
              <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=salt29">SALT 29 EasyChair site</a>.

            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              Abstracts must be anonymous. The main text should be at most 2
              pages (US Letter or A4) in length, with an optional third page for
              examples, references, or figures. The abstract should use a 12pt
              font and 1 inch margins (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4)
              on all four sides. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF
              file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to
              the intellectual interest of the abstract, clarity and readability
              will also be taken into account in reviewing. </p>
            <p>
              SALT 29 will feature a poster session. Poster presentations will
              be published as regular papers in the proceedings. Poster
              presenters will be asked to give a short lightning round
              presentation prior to the poster session. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Policies</h2>
            <p>
              Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the
              sole author of at most one abstract.
            </p>
            <p>
              SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been
              published or have been accepted for publication. In addition,
              preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated
              at other major conferences. We therefore request that authors
              indicate prior, pending, or planned presentations of their papers
              along with their contact information when they submit their
              abstracts.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Proceedings</h2>
            <p>
              All papers presented at the conference will be published in a SALT
              29 volume following the conclusion of the conference.

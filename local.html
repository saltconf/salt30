			  which you are encouraged to access in your own time. Abstracts 
			  will be available for each presentation. Presentation materials 
			  will be posted on OSF at the discretion of the presenters.

			  OSF project pages. This facilitates asynchronous participation 
			  for presenters and attendees who may be out of sync with the 
			  conference timezone.

			<h3>Zoom Etiquette</h3>
			<p>
			  We will be using the regular Zoom format to hold the conference.

			</p>  
			<p>
			  All participants will be muted upon entry to the zoom session. We 
			  ask that you keep your microphone muted during the presentation, 
			  and only unmute yourself during breaks or during the Q&ampA when 
			  instructed by the moderator. The moderator may mute you during a 
			  presentation if you forget to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
			  It is up to you whether your camera is on, but we would like to 
			  encourage you to turn the camera on during the Q&ampA period, 
			  especially if you are asking a question. You might also consider 
			  adding a picture of yourself to display while your camera is off.
			</p>
			<h3>Live Q&amp;A</h3>
			<p>
			  Questions will be handled through Zoom's 
			  <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/200941109-Attendee-controls-in-a-meeting">raise hand</a> 
			  feature and the chat. If you would like to ask your question, 
			  please raise your hand. If you would like to have your question 
			  read, please type it into the chat.

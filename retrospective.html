            <h2>SALT1-SALT30: A retrospective</h2>                       
            <p>
              The first SALT was organized in 1991 at Cornell University by 
              Gennaro Chierchia, Fred Landman, and Sally McConnell-Ginet. It 
              was held April 19-21, 1991. The invited speakers were 
              Greg Carlson, Irene Heim, Robert May, and Barbara Partee. SALT 
              has been held annually by different institutions ever since.
              (See the <a href="https://saltconf.github.io/history.html">SALT history page</a>)
            <p>
            </p>
              The panel, “SALT1 to SALT30: A Retrospective,” will include Sally 
              and Fred along with Veneeta Dayal, Manfred Krifka, Barbara Partee, 
              Craige Roberts, and Ede Zimmerman, who all gave talks at SALT1. 
              Unfortunately Gennaro cannot participate because of a conflict. Ede, 
              Manfred, and Veneeta are also giving talks at SALT30.

              In 1991, Sally was chair of what was then the Department of Modern 
              Languages and Linguistics (now the Department of Linguistics) 
              and her colleagues in semantics were Gennaro (with whom she had 
              cotaught introductory semantics for linguists and with whom she 
              had recently written <i>Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to 
              Semantics</i>) and Fred (with whom she later cotaught a seminar on 
              how to think about vagueness in formal models of meaning). 
              Veneeta Dayal (PhD Cornell 1991) 
              had just left to teach at Rutgers at the time of SALT1 -- she now 
              holds a named chair at Yale and will be giving one of the invited 
              talks at SALT30.   
              Gennaro left not long after SALT1, first to return to Milan in 
              his native Italy and then to join the Harvard linguistics 
              department, and then Fred left a few years later, to take a 
              position in the ling dept of Tel Aviv University. Sally is 
              a Professor Emerita at Cornell.

              About the conference itself, a lot has not changed since SALT1. 
              SALT was unusual when it began in 
              asking for relatively long abstracts and scheduling relatively long 
              talks with no parallel sessions. That meant and continues to mean 
              significant attention from virtually all attendees to a relatively 
              small number of talks. And there’s always been time built in for 
              people to talk informally with one another. Those important traditions 
              remain unchanged. What has changed, in order to help accommodate more 
              work without parallel sessions, is the introduction of poster sessions 
              with lightning talks. And this year, of course, there’s a big change: 
              all sessions are online!

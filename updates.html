            <h2>Updates on SALT30 Status</h2>

            <hr>

            <h3>10 March 2020</h3>

            <p>
            Today <a href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2020/20200310-coronavirus-update.cfm">Cornell announced</a> 
            that all classes are moving online after Spring Break and that campus 
            events are cancelled through the end of the semester. This means for sure 
            that SALT cannot be held in April, as scheduled. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Since last week, given the rapidly developing situation with the novel 
            coronavirus, we have been exploring the option of postponing SALT until  
            August. We are optimistic this is possible, but we haven't figured out the 
            details yet, due to checking with local constraints and other conflicts,  
            such as ESSLLI. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We will post another update as soon as we have more information, but given  
            today's developments, we wanted to post something immediately. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We are disappointed, as I'm sure you are, but we hope to be able to hold SALT 
            in August. As always, everyone's health and safety is the highest priority, 
            and we will keep in touch,
            </p>

            <p>
            Take care, and kind regards, <br />
            The SALT30 organizing committee
            </p>

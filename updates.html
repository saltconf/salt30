            <h2>Updates on SALT30 Status</h2>

            <p>
            The SALT 30 dates have been changed from April 23 &ndash; 26, 2020 
            to August 17 &ndash; 20, 2020 and the conference will now be held virtually 
            </p>
                    
            <hr>
            
            <h3>16 April 2020</h3>

            <p>
            As you know, we had to postpone SALT 30 and were planning to have it in person 
            in August. Since the last update, there have been several developments that made 
            this plan less feasible. We've explored several alternatives and consulted 
            with both the SALT steering committee and the Cornell administration. The 
            organizing committee met again yesterday and decided to move SALT 30 to an 
            entirely virtually format. We are very disappointed, as you may be, but we 
            think it's the best option given the current unpredictable situation. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The primary reasons for this decision are concerns over everyone's health and 
            well-being, uncertainty about summer and fall travel, and uncertainty about 
            events being allowed on campus. No events on campus at Cornell are allowed 
            until further notice, and we aren't sure how long that will last. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The dates for virtual SALT 30 will be August 17 &ndash; 20, 2020, with the 
            focus workshop on the 17th. More information will be coming soon about format 
            and platform, but we wanted to get you this update as soon as possible. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We're disappointed to not be able to see everyone in person, especially since 
            SALT started here at Cornell and we were looking forward to celebrating SALT 30. 
            We had such a wonderful event planned! However, the first all-virtual SALT will 
            be an occasion as well, I'm sure, and we'll find a way to celebrate and bring 
            everyone together outside of the talks. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We hope you all continue to be well. We also hope to find ways to replicate the 
            wonderful semantics community that always comes together at SALT, 
            <p>

            <p>
            Kind regards, <br />
            The SALT30 organizing committee
            </p>

            <h3>10 March 2020</h3>

            <p>
            Today <a href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2020/20200310-coronavirus-update.cfm">Cornell announced</a> 
            that all classes are moving online after Spring Break and that campus 
            events are cancelled through the end of the semester. This means for sure 
            that SALT cannot be held in April, as scheduled. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Since last week, given the rapidly developing situation with the novel 
            coronavirus, we have been exploring the option of postponing SALT until  
            August. We are optimistic this is possible, but we haven't figured out the 
            details yet, due to checking with local constraints and other conflicts,  
            such as ESSLLI. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We will post another update as soon as we have more information, but given  
            today's developments, we wanted to post something immediately. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We are disappointed, as I'm sure you are, but we hope to be able to hold SALT 
            in August. As always, everyone's health and safety is the highest priority, 
            and we will keep in touch,
            </p>

            <p>
            Take care, and kind regards, <br />
            The SALT30 organizing committee
            </p>

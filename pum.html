            <h2>About</h2>
			<p>
			  A major initiative by 
			  <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/about/who-we-are/committees/status-women-linguistics">
			  the LSA Committee on the Status of Women in Linguistics (COSWL)</a> is the 
			  <a href="https://womeninlinguistics.com/pump/">Pop-Up Mentoring Program</a> 
			  (PUMP). It is a series of events that travel around from conference to 
			  conference, giving anyone who is interested a chance to have a brief 
			  meeting with a mentor outside of their official support system.
			</p>
			<p>
			  This program is based on a successful &quot;speed mentoring&quot; program 
			  that has been run for many years by the American Psychosomatic Society, 
			  and is modeled after similar events organized by 
			  <a href="http://www.womenincogsci.org/announcement/new-wics-speed-mentoring-program" target="_blank">
			  Women in Cognitive Science (WiCS)</a>.&nbsp;There are several ground rules 
			  for this program:
			</p>
			<ol>
			  <li>This is a one-time session (i.e., the mentor is not signing on for a 
			  longer-term mentoring relationship);</li>
			  <li>The mentee should come with a specific question or two to guide the 
			  session and make the most of it;</li>
			  <li>The mentee should send the mentor some information about themselves 
			  and their question(s) ahead of time, but not expect that the mentor will 
			  have read this information prior to the meeting.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			  Additional information abou the Pop-Up Mentoring Program can be found 
			  <a href="https://womeninlinguistics.com/pump/">here</a>.
